# HyperEngine
The Non-Euclidean Unity Backend for Hyperbolica

**This codebase is not actively maintained and is simply provided as a reference for others interested in making their own non-Euclidean games. It is not the complete source to "Hyperbolica" and only represents what backend components I could easily separate from the game itself. HyperEngine is MIT licensed and you're free to use all or any part of this library in your own personal or commercial projects.**

Please read the included [HyperEngine.pdf](https://github.com/HackerPoet/HyperEngine/blob/main/HyperEngine.pdf) for a quick high-level documentation of the major components.

I also highly recommend watching all the devlogs #1 through #6 for a clearer picture about the purpose of this engine.
